  <p><em>A Cloud Engineer in the clouds.</em></p>
</div>

Originally from South Carolina, I earned a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from the University of South Carolina. During my time there, I developed a strong foundation in software development, network security, and database management. After college, I studied cloud engineering and front end development.

I've since pursued further education through MIT's Great Learning Education, focusing on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This advanced training has equipped me with cutting-edge knowledge in these fields, allowing me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and apply these concepts to real-world problems.

I'm a Cloud Engineer by trade, specializing in designing, implementing, and managing cloud infrastructure. My expertise includes working with platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, where I leverage the latest automation technologies to streamline processes and improve efficiency. I am particularly passionate about automating repetitive tasks to save time and reduce human error, which allows teams to focus on more strategic initiatives.

Beyond my professional life, I have a deep love for hiking and camping. Being outdoors and exploring nature provides me with a sense of peace and rejuvenation. It's a perfect counterbalance to the high-tech world I work in. I also have a passion for music, playing various instruments such as guitar, bass, piano and banjo to name a few. Music has always been a creative outlet for me, allowing me to express myself in unique ways.

I try to be as much of an open book as I can. If you are at all interested,
