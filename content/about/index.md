I'm a Cloud Engineer with a passion for music and web design, and a dedicated instructor. Originally from South Carolina, I earned a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from the University of South Carolina. I've since pursued further education at MIT, focusing on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
